    "## About the PostgreSQL relational database in the Smart Village Platform\n",
    "\n",
    "> A SQL statement goes into a restaurant, walks up to two tables, and asks \"may I join you?\" One of the members at one of the tables responds, \"Are we related?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "A relational SQL database like PostgreSQL is required by the ScorpioBroker to store smart device context data for each smart device. We also store configurable user data like traffic simulations, simulation reports, and more in the Smart Village application with PostgreSQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "A relational database like PostgreSQL is where live persistent data in an application belongs. The Smart Village Platform uses two separate tools for storing  data, including a relational database and a search engine. Some data in the Smart Village Platform is stored in the relational database as normalized data and in the search engine as denormalized data in the same database transaction. Normalized data in the relational database is the raw input data received without any additional calculations from the input data being stored. Denormalized data in the search engine is based off of the normalized data in the relational database, but with additional calculations performed to make it easily queriable with all the data required for display in the API or in a graphical dashboard. Some data may come from other sources, in which case it's not necessary to persist the data in the relational database and can be stored only in the search engine for retrieval in the API. PostgreSQL is the very best transactional database with support for IoT device data because it handles geolocation, unstructured, and structured data with confidence and ACID compliance. ACID compliance is a set of database characteristics consisting of Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability that ensure that database transactions are completed efficiently. We can take advantage of PostgreSQL in the Smart Village Platform and ScorpioBroker at the same time. \n"

    "\n",
    "- `enable_dev_nodeports: false` It's possible to enable nodeports to directly connect to PostgreSQL from your local computer, but not in NERC OpenShift, so we set this to false. \n",
    "- `crunchy: false` We can deploy the database with the Crunchy Postgres Operator, but Crunchy requires a large amount of memory and CPU resource quota, so we deploy a simplified container of Postgres instead in NERC OpenShift. \n",
    "- The `smartvillage-db-create` configMap definition configures the `db-create.sql` SQL script we looked at earlier to be run as part of the deployment. \n",
    "- The `instances:` definition defines the memory and CPU requests and limits for our database pod. We have to keep this lower than I would recommend for a production deployment because we have limited resources available in NERC OpenShift for the many running Smart Village services. \n",
    "- The `users:` definition creates a `smartvillage` database with a a `smartvillage` user as the owner, and a `scorpiobroker` database with a `scorpiobroker` user as the owner. \n",
    "- The `pg_hba:` definition allows the database users to be trusted to connect to their given databases and the correct password, which is automatically generated during deployment. \n",
