    "Here are some useful things to note about the configuration of the IoT Agent JSON. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `auth:` We configure the authentication to our Red Hat Single Sign-On Server, to register OAuth2 / OpenID Connect authentication and authorization in the application which is integrated with GitHub. \n",
    "- `ngsi_ld:` We configure an NGSI-LD to Smart Village Sync application that integrates with the context broker. This service subscribes to IoT Edge device data changes in the context broker. \n",
    "- `kafka:` We disable Kafka in the Smart Village application because running Kafka requires too many resources that we don't have in NERC OpenShift. \n",
    "- `zookeeper:` We will disable Zookeeper cluster manager because with all the starting and stopping of containers in NERC OpenShift, the applications using Zookeeper as a cluster manager can start throwing errors when being restarted or having the cluster manager go down. \n",
    "- `postgres:` We configure the host to the PostgreSQL service for persistence in the Smarta Byar Smart Village Platform. \n",
    "- `solr:` We configure the host to the Solr service for serving up API data in the Smarta Byar Smart Village Platform. \n",
    "- The `site:` definition defines the memory and CPU requests and limits for our Smart Village pod. We have to keep this lower than I would recommend for a production deployment because we have limited resources available in NERC OpenShift for the many running Smart Village services. \n",
    "- `import_data:` The Smart Village Platform can import data from various sources, but for this NERC OpenShift configuration, we disable data import. \n",
    "- `auth_role:` Each of the APIs in the Smart Village Platform require some kind of role-based access control. We have configured our Red Hat Single Sign-On Server `smartvillage-public` client to give all users the role `Public`. This means that any GitHub user who accesses their own application running in NERC OpenShift will be able to access the API. \n",
    "\n",
