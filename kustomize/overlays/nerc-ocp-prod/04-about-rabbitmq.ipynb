    "A message broker like RabbitMQ can receive messages from smart devices and forward them on to an IoT Agent to process the message. Smart devices often support sending AMQP or MQTT protocol messages. RabbitMQ supports AMQP, but the full MQTT version 5 spec used by FIWARE components is not yet supported in RabbitMQ, but will be released in RabbitMQ version 3.13, see [the RabbitMQ releases](https://www.rabbitmq.com/versions.html) and [the RabbitMQ post on MQTT 5](https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2023/07/mqtt5/). Red Hat AMQ Broker is another message broker that supports AMQP and MQTT version 5, but Red Hat AMQ Broker is not available to be deployed in NERC OpenShift, so we'll use RabbitMQ. \n"
